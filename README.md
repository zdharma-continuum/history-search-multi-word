# Introduction

Binds `Ctrl-R` to a widget that searches for multiple keywords in `AND` fashion.
In other words, you can enter multiple words, and history entries that match
all of them will be found. The entries are syntax highlighted.

Video – view on [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/88954). You can resize the video by pressing `Ctrl-+` or `Cmd-+`.

HSMW has feature called **context viewing** – see all occurrences of a command together
with surrounding commands:

Set:

```zsh
    zstyle :plugin:history-search-multi-word reset-prompt-protect 1
```

to be able to use `zle reset-prompt` in your e.g. `sched` calls, in presence of
`zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting`, `zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting`,
`zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions` and other plugins that hook up into Zshell by
overloading Zle widgets. You could e.g. use `sched` in following way:

```zsh
PROMPT=%B%F{yellow}%D{%H:%M:%S}%B%b%f
schedprompt() {
    zle && zle reset-prompt
    sched +1 schedprompt
}

zmodload -i zsh/sched
schedprompt
```

to refresh the clock in prompt every second. The `reset-prompt-protect` zstyle
needs to be set to 1 for correct cooperation with HSMW. Or, you could use `zle
.reset-prompt` (i.e. with the dot in front) to call the original, not
overloaded (by F-Sy-H, zsh-autosuggestsions, etc.) `reset-prompt` widget.

# News
* 14-07-2020
  - If an `[…]` string will occur in the search query, it'll be interpreted as
    pattern. So that it's possible to enter as the search query e.g.: `print
    ["a-zA-Z0-9_-]` or `print [^[:alpha:]]`, etc.

* 28-10-2019
  - `^` – if first – matches beginning of the command's string, $ – if last –
    its end. So that it's possible to enter `'^ls'` and have only commands
    starting with `ls` matched.

* 25-05-2018
  - Hash holding paths that shouldn't be grepped (globbed) – blacklist for slow disks, mounts, etc.:

    ```zsh
    typeset -gA FAST_BLIST_PATTERNS
    FAST_BLIST_PATTERNS[/mount/nfs1/*]=1
    FAST_BLIST_PATTERNS[/mount/disk2/*]=1
    ```

* 13-06-2017
  - Canceling search doesn't clear entered query. Change to previous behavior via:

    ```zsh
    zstyle ":plugin:history-search-multi-word" clear-on-cancel "yes"
    ```

* 12-04-2017
  - Page size can be relative to screen height, e.g.:

    ```zsh
    zstyle ":history-search-multi-word" page-size "LINES/4"
    ```

* 05-04-2017
  - 17% performance optimization

* 27-01-2017
  - Input-driven case-sensivity of search – if your query contains capital latin letters, search will be case-sensitive

* 12-11-2016
  - HSMW can now show context of selected history entry! Just hit `Ctrl-K`, [video](https://asciinema.org/a/92516)
  - More performance optimizations

* 31-10-2016
  - Newlines do not disturb the parser anymore, and are also highlighted with a dark color – [video](https://asciinema.org/a/91159)

* 27-10-2016
  - New optimizations – **30%** speed up of syntax highlighting!
  - Architectural change – syntax highlighting is now computed rarely, so any possible performance problems are now solved, in advance!

* 24-10-2016
  - Workaround for Zsh versions like 5.0.2 has been added – **Ctrl-V** and **ESC** cancel search. On such Zsh
    versions Ctrl-C might not work. Fully problem-free Zsh version will be the upcoming 5.3, where
    I have together with Zsh Hackers fully fixed the Ctrl-C issue.

* 22-10-2016
  - Search process has been optimized by 20%! History sizes like 100000 are now supported.
  - Active history entry can be `underline`, `standout` (i.e. inverse video), `bold`, `bg=blue`, etc. with
    the new Zstyle `:plugin:history-search-multi-word / active` (see Zstyles section) – [video](https://asciinema.org/a/90214).

* 16-10-2016
  - More optimizations of syntax highlighting (40% in total for the two days) – new video above.

* 15-10-2016
  - The compact, already optimized (by me) [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) part has been further optimized by 21%!
    Also, more tokens are highlighted – variable expressions like `"${(@)var[1,3]}"` (when quoted).

* 11-10-2016
  - Syntax highlighting of history – adapted, fine crafted, **small** part of [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
    to color what `hsmw` shows:

    ![syntax highlighting](http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img921/1503/bMAF59.gif)

* 20-09-2016
  - Keys Page Up and Page Down work and page-wise move along history. Also, `Ctrl-P`, `Ctrl-N`
    move to previous and next entries.

* 19-09-2016
  - Better immunity to [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
    and [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) – home,
    end, left and right cursor keys now work smoothly.

* 25-05-2016
  - Cooperation with
    [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
    plugin
  - Configuration option to set page size, example use:

    ```zsh
    zstyle ":history-search-multi-word" page-size "5"
    ```

# Installation

**The plugin is "standalone"**, which means that only sourcing it is needed. So to
install, unpack `history-search-multi-word` somewhere and add

```zsh
source {where-hsmw-is}/history-search-multi-word.plugin.zsh
```

to `zshrc`.

If using a plugin manager, then `Zinit` is recommended, but you can use any
other too, and also install with `Oh My Zsh` (by copying directory to
`~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`).


### [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)

Add `zinit load zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word` to your `.zshrc` file.
Zinit will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you
start zsh.

### Antigen

Add `antigen bundle zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word` to your `.zshrc` file.
Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you
start zsh. You can also add the plugin to a running zsh with `antigen bundle
zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word` for testing before adding it to your
`.zshrc`.

### Oh-My-Zsh

1. `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`
2. `git clone git@github.com:zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word.git`
3. Add `history-search-multi-word` to your plugin list

### Zgen

Add `zgen load zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word` to your .zshrc file in the same
place you're doing your other `zgen load` calls in.

### [Sheldon](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon)

Run 
```bash
sheldon add history-search-multi-word --github zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word
```

and add `bindkey "^R" history-search-multi-word` to `.zshrc` to enable the keybinding.


### Arch Linux

1. Install [`zsh-history-search-multi-word-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zsh-history-search-multi-word-git/) from the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository).

2. Add the following to your `.zshrc`:

    ```sh
    source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/history-search-multi-word/history-search-multi-word.plugin.zsh
    ```

3. Start a new terminal session


# Customizing

## Zstyles

```zsh
zstyle ":history-search-multi-word" page-size "8"                      # Number of entries to show (default is $LINES/3)
zstyle ":history-search-multi-word" highlight-color "fg=yellow,bold"   # Color in which to highlight matched, searched text (default bg=17 on 256-color terminals)
zstyle ":plugin:history-search-multi-word" synhl "yes"                 # Whether to perform syntax highlighting (default true)
zstyle ":plugin:history-search-multi-word" active "underline"          # Effect on active history entry. Try: standout, bold, bg=blue (default underline)
zstyle ":plugin:history-search-multi-word" check-paths "yes"           # Whether to check paths for existence and mark with magenta (default true)
zstyle ":plugin:history-search-multi-word" clear-on-cancel "no"        # Whether pressing Ctrl-C or ESC should clear entered query
```

## Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is customized via `HSMW_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES` associative array.
It has keys like `reserved-word`, `alias`, `command`, `path`, etc. which are assigned
with strings like `fg=blue,bold`, to configure how given elements are to be
colored. If you assign this array before or after loading `hsmw` you will change the defaults. Complete list
of available keys is [at the beginning](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word/blob/master/hsmw-highlight#L34-L62)
of `hsmw-highlight` file. Example `~/.zshrc` addition that sets `path` key –
paths that exist will be highlighted with background magenta, foreground white, bold:

```zsh
typeset -gA HSMW_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES
HSMW_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[path]="bg=magenta,fg=white,bold"
```

Following code will enable coloring of options of form "-o" and "--option", with cyan:

```zsh
typeset -gA HSMW_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES
HSMW_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[single-hyphen-option]="fg=cyan"
HSMW_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[double-hyphen-option]="fg=cyan"
```

Following code will use 256 colors to highlight command separators (like ";" or "&&"):

```zsh
HSMW_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[commandseparator]="fg=241,bg=17"
```
